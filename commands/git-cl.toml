I need to update my CHANGELOG.md.
1. Analyze the 'Current Changelog' below to find the date of the most recent entry.
2. Review the 'Recent Git Log' to find commits made *after* that date.
3. Format these new commits into a changelog entry following https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/
4. Output *only* the new markdown content to be appended.

--- CURRENT CHANGELOG ---
!{cat CHANGELOG.md || echo "No existing changelog."}

--- RECENT GIT LOG ---
!{git log -n 50 --pretty=format:"%ad - %s" --date=short}
